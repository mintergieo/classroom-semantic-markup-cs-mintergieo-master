     <h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
     <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
          <p>Again, it used to be done <i>like this</i>. This is wrong. This is the <em>right way</em>.</p>

     <h3>Separation of concerns</h3>
     <!-- description -->
          <p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>

     <section class="links">
     <!-- title for next section -->
     <h2>Links</h2>
     <!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
          <p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to <a href="https://github.com/">place</a> on the internet.</p>

     <h2>Sections</h2>
     <!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
          <p>Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this</p>
